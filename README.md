## Learning Vid Roulette
Learning Vid Roulette is an exploration into D3 using the Khan Academy API. Just tell the app how much time you have and select your topic of choice, then the app will search the Khan Academy API for a video that fits the bill.

## Technologies/APIs
Python, Flask, D3, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, HTML/CSS, Heroku, cPickle, Crontab, Khan Academy API

## How It Works

First, select a time preference.

Then, browse through the Khan Academy topics for one that sounds interesting.

Select a node to generate a video suggestion.

Finally, click on the button to go watch the video. (Or if that one doesn't sound interesting, go grab another!)

## Why I Built This
... Aside from the fact that I wanted to play around with D3 and needed a large dataset to experiment with? 

I chose to build Learning Video Roulette to serve my thirst to use any (and every) extra moment of the day to take advantage of online learning opportunities. I'm an avid participant in online learning tools, but often use them in a different way than (I believe) they are intended to be used. Instead of following a week-by-week curriculum, I often enjoy binging on particular topics for whatever amount of time I happen to have at that given moment.

This app was both a fun beginner's take on building something in D3, while also fitting my need for finding new videos at the drop of a hat.
